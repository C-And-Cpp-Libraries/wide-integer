# wide-integer
Wide-Integer implements a generic C++ template for uint128_t, uint256_t, uint512_t, uint1024_t, etc.

At the moment, wide-integer is limited to unsigned integral types having bit counts that are powers of 2 greater than or equal to 128.

Wide-Integer has been tested on numerous compilers and is specifically designed for use with all systems including deeply embedded hard real-time programming environments.
